<a href = ""> _______ </a> - links
<p> - paragraphs (newline with space)
<br> - break(newline)

<img src = "url/image name in folder"		             # can add style = "width:___; height:___;"
<center> = center images/anything under the tag


classes use ".class" in css
but for id, use "#id"

<div> tags are block elements

Position Property css:
  static(default value) - comes after the previous block -> normal order (one after the other)
  relative - new position relative to (what would've been) its normal position -> also needs to set coordinates
  absolute - position relative to its parent (if no parent elements, the original <html> document will be its parent)
  fixed - similar to absolute, but only relative to <html> doc and not any other parent (not affected by scrolling)
  sticky - behaves like relative originally, but afterwards if something happens (scrolling), it becomes fixed

text-decoration: (overline, underline, line-through, underline overline)
line-height: (normal, 1.6, 10%) -> vertical spacing

spacing can use px or em (which is number of spaces relative to font size)

bottom starts from bottom up for positioning
